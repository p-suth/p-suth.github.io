<p>I am a linguist specializing in endangered languages, a photographer, a musician, and a writer based in Philadelphia, US.</p><img src="pers.png" style="float: right; height: 30%; padding: 1%;"/>
<p>My vocations are rooted in a strong desire to be of service to communities with whom I feel an affinity, who are fighting against the oppressive and homogenizing forces of globalization, neo-liberalism and colonialism, be they ethnic groups, grassroots movements or underground arts communities.</p>
<p>Raised in London and attended the University of Glasgow for a BSc in Geography, it wasn't until trips to Iceland beginning in 2009 that my dual interests in languages and photography arose. Over the next few years I became involved in the polyglot community, resided in Iceland, traveled the world with my wife and completed an MA in Language Documentation & Description. I moved to the US in 2016 where I continue my work, focusing on archiving and how computers can be used to assist language revitalization efforts.</p>
<p>I see my work in all fields as a web of interconnected specializations that support each other and challenge me to grow. For example, in late 2016 I decided to learn Python with the ultimate goal of applying Natural Language Processing to endangered language projects. In order to get acquainted with it I developed a highly flexible looper pedal for use in live music settings. Paraphrasing a postcard: everything is interconnected, the trick is to recognize that.</p>
