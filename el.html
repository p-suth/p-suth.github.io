<h1><p>My work</p></h1>
<p>I am a language activist and linguist with formal training in a wide range of associated disciplines including theoretical linguistics, sociolinguistics, language documentation, and language policy. I have wide-ranging experience with issues of language endangerment, including: working with communities and other linguists to develop language dictionaries and apps; curating language recordings and metadata for upload to publicly accessible language archives; teaching programs and standards of language documentation; advising UNESCO on projects and approaches relating to the topic; publicizing its importance; and organizing talks and community events. Please see my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="writing.html">publications</a> for full details.</p>
<p>Besides language endangerment, I also have an interest in phonology and the sociolinguistics of writing, coining the term 'writing system mimicry' to describe a prevalent yet underdescribed feature in the linguistic landscape.</p>
<h1><p>Why is language revitalization important?</p></h1>
<p>Indigenous communities around the world have long been subjected to oppression and minoritization from other groups. The results of this oppression are many, and include culture, of which language is an important component. Indigenous and migrant communities are recognizing the value of their heritage language as part of their enduring culture, and their very efforts to revive and revitalize their languages are a stand against historic and current injustices. To these communities, language is a vital part of self-expression, and the mission that may be broadly termed 'language revitalization' requires participation, acceptance and embrace from not just the communities themselves but the wider population as a whole.</p>
<p>Linguistics as an academic science owes its existence to the variety of languages in the world, and therefore it is also vital to these scientists that languages are recorded, analyzed, and remain vital.</p>
<h1><p>Positioning myself</p></h1>
<p>I see myself as serving a dual role in endangered language work. On the one hand I am a language activist who is keenly interested in the communities' efforts to awaken their languages and keep them in use. I am most comfortable being in service, assisting projects while being constantly aware of my position as someone without indigenous heritage. On the other hand I am a university-trained linguist with an understanding of the importance of endangered languages to the discipline. Coming from both angles I am well prepared to interpret the perspectives, requirements and terminologies of various groups that have a stake in languages' vitality, and ones that do not.</p>
<h1><p>Working for you</p></h1>
<p>With this in mind, I am dedicating my career to working with a variety of groups for the benefit of indigenous communities around the world, particularly in North America, where I am now based. I am always looking to be involved in more projects, so please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me!</p>
